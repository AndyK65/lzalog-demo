A minimum viable product (MVP) is a version of a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers and provide
feedback for future product development.
Gathering insights from an MVP is often less expensive than developing a product with more features, 
which increases costs and risk if the product fails, for example, due to incorrect assumptions.
The term was coined and defined in 2001 by Frank Robinson[4] and then popularized by Steve Blank and Eric Ries.
It may also involve carrying out market analysis beforehand.
